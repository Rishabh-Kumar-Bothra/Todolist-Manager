	we also propagate the idea of Open Source Community and Mozilla in all the students of our college by organising various workshops and seminars
	about various contributions to mozilla community.
 </p>
 <div class='cont'> STRUCTURE OF THE COMMUNITY </div>
 <p> Two major groups constitute the Community. These are:
  <ul>
  <li>Technical Contributors</li>
  <li>Non technical Contributors</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>
  But, an individual contributing in a technical project , can also be an active part of another non technical project and vice versa. 
  We make sure , that everyone gets the opportunity to take up various leadership and managerial roles. 
  We heartily welcome any type of contributor and they can opt to be a part of any of the project, depending on his/her field of interest.
